Hospitality Project
This project was created as part of the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge. The challenge aimed to provide practical experience and showcase skills in data visualization and business intelligence using Power BI.

Description
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective management decisions, AtliQ Grands is losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.

This project analyzes key performance metrics for the hotel business over a 3-month period (May, June, July), focusing on Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy Rates, and other KPIs. It includes insights on performance across weekdays and weekends, customer behavior, and booking platform trends. Recommendations are provided based on observed patterns to improve room quality, customer engagement, and business performance.
