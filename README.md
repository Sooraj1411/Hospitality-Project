## __Description__
_AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in_ _management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.

It includes insights on performance across_ _weekdays and weekends, customer behavior, and booking platform trends. Recommendations are provided based on observed patterns to improve room quality, customer engagement, and business performance._
