# **Hospitality-Project**

_This project was created as part of the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge. The challenge aimed to provide practical experience and showcase skills in data visualization and business intelligence using Power BI._

## __Description__
_AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in_ _management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data_ _Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue._ <br>

_This project analyzes key performance metrics for a hotel business over a 3-month period (May, June, July), focusing on Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy Rates, and other KPIs. It includes insights on performance across_ _weekdays and weekends, customer behavior, and booking platform trends. Recommendations are provided based on observed patterns to improve room quality, customer engagement, and business performance._
